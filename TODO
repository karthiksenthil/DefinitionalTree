The following is a list of tasks to be done :

Main Tasks:
1. Completely change compile.rb to produce a H function(like in tmp/h_append.rb) as output -- Done, without review
2. Implementing the N function -- Done
3. Handle the case of Variable and Choice for H function

Sub Tasks:
1. Test the replacment functionality of Box -- Done
2. Change the unit test tests/test_compile.rb to match the output from main task 1
3. Remove redundant classes/functions like pseudo_replace.rb, classes H,N,A
4. Remove temporary code from expressions.rb like line 186-190
5. Documentation of code
6. Add unit test for find_path functionality(3 examples)
7. Test the refactored examples and their corresponding H outputs, make test expressions

Discussion:
1. Format of output H function produced by new_compile
2. File structure and directory structure for output of new_compile
