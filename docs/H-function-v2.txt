The runtime defines a function f.H for each operation symbol f.
Function f.H takes an argument identified by expr.
For example, where CT_head is the head-of-a-list function

  def CT_head.H(expr)
    ...
  end

This is the contract for f.H
When f.H(expr) begins execution, expr is a full application of f
to some arguments, i.e., expr=f(t1,...tn), where n is the arity of f
When f.H(expr) ends execution expr=c(t1,...tk), where c is a constructor
symbol of arity k, or c is the fail symbol.  
f.H(expr) also return the updated expr.
The updated expr has been derived from the initial expr by rewrite steps.

The body of f.H is composed by a few patterns.
There is a possibly empty set of nested cases.
The selector of a case is either an argument of expr (and so a variable)
or an expression.  These two cases call for a different behavior.

  def CT_head.H(expr) # "head"
    selector = expr.content.arguments[0]
    loop {
      case selector.content.symbol.token
      when ...
      end
    }
  end

The selector must be evaluated to HNF.  If it is not, then it will
be.  After that the loop is traversed again and this time the
selector will select a branch leading to a rewrite  step.

Each branch of the case either is a nested case or follows one of 5
patterns depending on the token of the selector.

token=0: the selector is variable.  The variable is instantiated by a
generator.  Not yet implemented.

token=1 and token=3: the selector is rooted by g, where g is either
an operation or the choice symbol. The selector is head normalized
and the loop iterated.  The code is

      selector.H()
      break

token=2: expr is replaced by a failure.

      expr.replace(CT_External::FAILED)
      return expr

token=x, where x >= 4: An expression, rhs, corresponding to a rule
right-hand side is constructed and expr is replaced by rhs.
If after the replacement expr is not rooted by a constructor,
H is inviked for expr again.


      rhs = expr.content.arguments[0].content.arguments[0]
      expr.replace(rhs.content)
      if expr.content.symbol.token == OPERATION
        expr.H()
      end
      return expr

The test is avoided when the root of rhs is known at compile time.
