# Example to construct definitonal trees for a curry program

# 3 operations : append, last & cond

# Rules for append -
# General rule -> append xs ys
# 1. append [] ys = ys
# 2. append (z:zs) ys = z:(append zs ys)

# Rules for rev -
# General rule -> last xs
# 1. last xs = cond (append xs x =:= xs) x

# Rules for cond -
# General rule -> cond xs ys
# 1. cond success ys = ys

# here =:= is constained equality operator

# import the append operation's definitional tree from append.rb
