# 2 operations : append & rev

# Rules for append -
# General rule -> append xs ys
# 1. append [] ys = ys
# 2. append (z:zs) ys = z:(append zs ys)

# Rules for rev -
# General rule -> rev xs
# 1. rev [] = []
# 2. rev (x:xs) = append (rev xs) [x]

# import the append operation's definitional tree from append.rb
